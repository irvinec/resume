I graduated from the University of Arizona in 2011 with a BS in Math and Computer Science. I was an Undergraduate TA for both the Math and Computer Science departments. My undergraduate research was in Computational Photonics and used a Genetic Algorithm to optimize thermal output of dialectic materials. I was a summer intern at Microsoft in 2010 and hired full time in 2011. I received the Windows Phone Excellence in Execution award while I was working on NFC related operating system components in 2012. I shipped Applications on various platforms from 2013 to 2015 including Windows, Android, and iOS. I joined Amazon in 2015 working on a data ingestion pipeline for 3rd party seller data. I rejoined Microsoft in 2016 and worked on the Edge browser, app install services, and Windows Update.
